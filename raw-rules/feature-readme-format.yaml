  - "Check for required sections — Both \"For Humans\" and \"For AI\" sections exist"
  - "Verify AI metadata — `<!-- AI_META -->` comment with proper JSON/YAML block"
  - "Validate metadata keys — Required keys: `purpose`, `publicApi`, `dependencies`, `tests`"
  - "If structure missing/incorrect, prompt with minimal template"

# CORRECT APPROACH

  **Required README structure:**
  
  # For Humans

  ## How to Test

  **Alternative YAML format:**
  
  # For AI
  
  <!-- AI_META -->
  ```yaml
  purpose: Brief description of slice purpose
  publicApi:
    - List of public API endpoints or functions
  dependencies:
    - List of dependencies this slice uses
  tests:
    location: Path to test files
    command: Command to run tests
  ```

# DETECTION PATTERNS
flagged_regex:
  - "missing # For Humans header"
  - "missing # For AI header"
  - "missing <!-- AI_META --> comment"
  - "missing required metadata keys"
  - "invalid JSON/YAML syntax"
  - "incorrect section order"
  - "extra top-level sections"

# SUGGESTED SOLUTIONS
solutions:
  - "Add both 'For Humans' and 'For AI' top-level sections"
  - "Include <!-- AI_META --> comment with JSON/YAML metadata block"
  - "Ensure all required keys: purpose, publicApi, dependencies, tests"
  - "Use minimal template to fix README.md structure"
  - "Validate JSON/YAML syntax in metadata block"
  - "Correct section order: For Humans first, then For AI"
  - "Remove extra sections beyond the required two"

# EXCEPTIONS
rule_exceptions:
  - "YAML format instead of JSON for metadata"
  - "Additional sections beyond required two"
  - "Extended metadata with layer-specific information"
  - "Legacy README files during migration"
  - "Third-party slice documentation with different standards"
