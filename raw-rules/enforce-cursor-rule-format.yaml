# Anti-patterns
anti_patterns:
  - "Using deprecated .cursorrules file"
  - "Missing metadata front matter"
  - "Incorrect metadata keys or order"

  - "Verbose or redundant content"
  - "Rules solving multiple unrelated problems"
  - "Inconsistent markdown formatting"
  - "Overlapping functionality between rules"

# Correct pattern
correct_pattern: |
  **Required structure:**
  ```
  .cursor/rules/<rule-name>.mdc with metadata:
  ---
  description: "Brief description"
  globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.jsx"]
  alwaysApply: false
  ---
  
  # Rule Title
  Description
  
  ## Requirements
  - Requirement 1
  - Requirement 2
  
  ## Examples
  ✅ Good examples
  ❌ Bad examples

# Flagged patterns
flagged_patterns:
  - ".cursorrules file usage"
  - "missing front matter"
  - "incorrect metadata structure"
  - "duplicate functionality"
  - "conflicting requirements"
  - "verbose explanations"
  - "multiple unrelated problems in one rule"

# Solutions
suggested_solutions:
  - "Move rules to .cursor/rules/ directory"
  - "Add proper metadata front matter"
  - "Consolidate similar functionality"
  - "Resolve conflicts before implementation"
  - "Eliminate verbose content"
  - "Split multi-problem rules"
  - "Use consistent markdown formatting"

# Exceptions
exceptions:
  - "Rules with additional metadata (if needed)"
  - "Complex rules requiring multiple sections"
  - "Rules extending other rules appropriately"
