    - "Parse user request for architectural implications"

    - "If no conflicts → Proceed with file_clarification_requirement"

# File clarification requirements
file_clarification_requirement:
  always_clarify_file_references: |
    When files/components mentioned without explicit paths:
    
    **❌ Never assume** which files the user is referring to
    **✅ Always ask for clarification:**
    
    ```
    I need to clarify which files you're referring to. Are you talking about:
    - [List specific file paths/options]
    - Or different files entirely?
    
    Please specify exact file paths or provide more context.
    ```

# README analysis requirements

  mandatory_readme_study: "Before making changes, **always** read relevant README files"

    - "`app/widgets/{widget}/README.md`"
    - "`app/entities/{entity}/README.md`"
    - "`app/pages/{page}/README.md`"

# Strict scope adherence
strict_scope_adherence:
  never_do:
    - "❌ Never add improvements/enhancements not requested"
    - "❌ Never suggest additional features unless asked"
    - "❌ Never optimize code unless optimization requested"

    - "✅ Implement exactly what user asked for"
    - "✅ Stay focused on specific requirements"

# File editing error handling

# Conflict resolution requirement

  always_report_inconsistencies:
    - "Conflicting instructions within request"

    I've identified an inconsistency/conflict:
    
    **Issue**: [Describe specific conflict]
    **Details**: [Explain what's conflicting]
    **Options**: [List possible approaches]
    
    How would you like me to proceed?

# Mandatory slice baseline verification
mandatory_slice_baseline_verification:
  description: "🚨 BEFORE STARTING ANY SLICE WORK:"
  step_0_baseline_check:
    requirement: "MUST perform baseline check before development"
    steps:
      - "Identify target slice and layer from user request"
      - "Run baseline verification using checklist:"
      - "  - Features: api.ts, api.spec.ts, hooks.ts, hooks.spec.ts, ui/, README.md, index.ts"
      - "  - Pages: ui/index.tsx, ui/index.spec.tsx, README.md, index.ts, route file"
      - "  - Widgets: ui/, tests, README.md, index.ts"
      - "  - Entities: model/, README.md, index.ts"
      - "If ANY baseline file missing → auto-create using generators"
      - "No user confirmation needed - auto-create immediately"

# Task complexity classification
task_complexity_classification:
  simple_task_definition: |
    ✅ **Simple Task** (≤3 steps, single slice/component):
    - Creating/editing single component
    - Adding one API endpoint
    - Writing single test file
    - Small UI adjustments
    - Bug fixes in single file
    
  complex_task_definition: |
    🔥 **Complex Task** (>3 steps, multiple slices/cross-cutting):
    - Feature development across multiple slices
    - API integration with UI changes
    - Migration/refactoring tasks
    - Multi-component interactions
    - Cross-layer dependencies

  memory_management:
    simple_tasks: "Keep all context and steps in active memory - no temporary files needed"
    complex_tasks: "Create temporary markdown file with step-by-step plan, follow it, then delete file"
    
    complex_task_workflow: |
      1. Create `/tmp/task-plan-[timestamp].md` with detailed steps
      2. Follow plan step-by-step, updating progress
      3. Delete temporary file after completion
      4. Keep only essential context in memory

# Step-by-step execution
step_by_step_execution:
  simple_tasks_format: |
    **Execution Plan:**
    
    STEP 0: 🚨 MANDATORY BASELINE VERIFICATION
    - Target slice: app/[layer]/[slice]/
    - Baseline check: [checklist type]
    - Missing files: [list or "All present ✅"]
    - Action: [Create missing files or "Complete ✅"]
    
    1. [Description] - Generator: [Yes/No - which one]
    2. [Description] - Generator: [Yes/No - which one]
    3. [Description] - Manual: [Only if no generator]
    
    FINAL VALIDATION:
    - npm run lint:fix
    - npm run type-check (zero tolerance)
    - npm run test
    - Baseline re-verification

# Anti-patterns
anti_patterns:
  - "Making assumptions about file references"
  - "Skipping README analysis"
  - "Adding unrequested improvements"
  - "Complex workarounds for simple failures"
  - "Not reporting conflicts"
  - "Proceeding without execution plan"
  - "Manual creation without generator checks"
  - "Skipped validation steps"
  - "Unresolved TypeScript errors"
  - "Using complex task approach for simple tasks"
  - "Keeping temporary plan files after completion"
  - "Not creating plan files for complex tasks"

# Correct pattern
correct_pattern: |
  **Process flow:**
  1. Classify task complexity (simple ≤3 steps vs complex >3 steps)
  2. Architectural validation checkpoint
  3. File clarification if needed
  4. README analysis for affected entities
  5. Mandatory baseline verification (Step 0)
  6. For complex tasks: Create temporary plan file in /tmp/
  7. Execution plan with generator checks
  8. Step-by-step implementation
  9. Complete validation workflow
  10. Baseline re-verification
  11. For complex tasks: Delete temporary plan file

# Enforcement - no exceptions

    - "Ignore missing README.md files"
    - "Ask confirmation before creating baseline files"
  
  must_always:
    - "Run baseline verification first"
    - "Auto-create missing baseline files using generators"

# Solutions
suggested_solutions:
  - "Ask for clarification on ambiguous references"
  - "Read README files before changes"
  - "Stick to requested scope"
  - "Use systematic approach for failures"
  - "Report conflicts and ask guidance"
