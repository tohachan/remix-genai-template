# Critical Workflow Validation

This rule provides additional validation layers for development practices beyond specific generator rules. It focuses on general workflow compliance and quality assurance.

## 🎯 WORKFLOW VALIDATION SCOPE

This rule validates adherence to:
- Generator usage (references `enforce-plop-generator.mdc`)
- File structure compliance 
- Quality standards maintenance
- Development best practices

## 📋 POST-STEP VERIFICATION

After each development step completion:

### File Creation Verification:
```
1. ✅ Files created using proper method (generator or justified manual)
2. ✅ All required files present (main, tests, exports)
3. ✅ No manual creation where generator was available
4. ✅ Documentation updated if needed
```

### Quality Assurance Verification:
```
1. ✅ Code follows project standards
2. ✅ Tests are included where required
3. ✅ Documentation is updated
4. ✅ FSD architecture compliance maintained
```

## 🔍 COMPLIANCE MONITORING

### Generator Compliance Check:
- Verify components created via CLI generators (see `enforce-plop-generator.mdc`)
- Confirm proper file structure and naming
- Validate test coverage requirements

### Architecture Compliance Check:
- FSD layer boundaries respected
- Import rules followed
- Proper segment usage

## 💡 IMPROVEMENT TRACKING

### Regular Self-Assessment Questions:
- Am I consistently following project standards?
- Are there recurring issues in my workflow?
- What improvements can be made to prevent mistakes?

### Quality Metrics:
- Reduced manual file creation incidents
- Improved generator adoption rates
- Better adherence to architectural patterns
- Faster development cycles with fewer errors

## 🎯 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER RULES

This rule works as a validation layer for:
- `enforce-plop-generator.mdc` - Generator usage enforcement
- `enforce-project-structure.mdc` - FSD compliance
- `feature-slice-baseline.mdc` - Feature requirements
- `require-pure-function-tests.mdc` - Testing standards

This rule serves as a quality gate to ensure consistent, high-quality development practices across all project work.
