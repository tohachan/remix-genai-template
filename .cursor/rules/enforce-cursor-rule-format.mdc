globs: []
alwaysApply: true

- Store **all** project rules under `.cursor/rules/`. **Do not** use the deprecated `.cursorrules` file.
- Name each rule file `<rule-name>.mdc`. The filename (minus `.mdc`) **must** exactly match the rule identifier.
- Each `.mdc` file **must** include metadata front matter with **exactly** these keys in this order:
  1. `description`    (string describing the rule's purpose)  
  2. `globs`          (array of file-pattern strings; `[]` if none)  
  3. `alwaysApply`    (boolean; `true` for always-applied rules)  
- Do **not** add any other top-level keys in the metadata block.
- Whenever Cursor applies any rule, it **must** emit a log line:
  [Cursor Rule] Applying <filename> – <ruleName>
  - Because `alwaysApply: true`, this rule will be included in **every** context—especially whenever you prompt to create, update, or generate rules—guaranteeing consistency.

## Rule Content Structure Requirements

- **Each rule within a file must have clear and consistent structure** with well-defined sections and formatting
- **Rules must not duplicate or repeat** - similar functionality should be consolidated into a single, comprehensive rule
- **Rules must not contradict each other** - conflicting requirements should be resolved before implementation
- **Rules must be concise and focused** - eliminate unnecessary content, verbose explanations, or redundant information
- **Each rule must be clearly separated** from others using appropriate markdown formatting (headers, lists, etc.)
- **Each rule must solve exactly one specific problem** - avoid combining multiple unrelated requirements in a single rule

## Conflict Detection and Resolution

- **Before adding or updating any rule**, check for:
  - Existing rules with similar functionality
  - Potential conflicts with established rules
  - Redundant or overlapping requirements
- **If conflicts or similar rules are found**, immediately report to the user:
  - List the conflicting/similar rules
  - Explain the specific conflicts or overlaps
  - Propose resolution strategies (merge, modify, or replace)
- **Do not proceed** with rule creation/updates until conflicts are resolved
