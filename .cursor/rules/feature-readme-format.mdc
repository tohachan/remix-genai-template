# FSD Slice README Format Requirements

This rule enforces a standardized format for `README.md` files in FSD slice directories (`app/features/*/README.md`, `app/pages/*/README.md`, `app/widgets/*/README.md`, `app/entities/*/README.md`) to ensure consistent documentation for both human developers and AI systems.

## Required Structure

Each slice README **must** contain exactly two top-level sections:

### 1. For Humans Section
- **Header**: `# For Humans`
- **Content**: Markdown description including:
  - Slice description/purpose
  - How to run the slice
  - How to test the slice
  - Any additional human-readable documentation

### 2. For AI Section
- **Header**: `# For AI`
- **Content**: Must include `<!-- AI_META -->` comment followed by a JSON or YAML code block
- **Required metadata keys**:
  - `purpose` — Brief description of the slice's purpose
  - `publicApi` — Public API endpoints/functions exposed by this slice
  - `dependencies` — Dependencies this slice relies on
  - `tests` — Testing information and test file locations

## Expected Format

```markdown
# For Humans

[Slice description in markdown]

## How to Run
[Instructions for running this slice]

## How to Test  
[Instructions for testing this slice]

# For AI

<!-- AI_META -->
```json
{
  "purpose": "Brief description of slice purpose",
  "publicApi": [
    "List of public API endpoints or functions"
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    "List of dependencies this slice uses"
  ],
  "tests": {
    "location": "Path to test files",
    "command": "Command to run tests"
  }
}
```

[Additional AI-readable documentation]
```

## Alternative YAML Format

The AI metadata can also be provided as YAML:

```markdown
# For AI

<!-- AI_META -->
```yaml
purpose: Brief description of slice purpose
publicApi:
  - List of public API endpoints or functions
dependencies:
  - List of dependencies this slice uses
tests:
  location: Path to test files
  command: Command to run tests
```
```

## Enforcement Rules

When working with FSD slice README files (`app/{features,pages,widgets,entities}/*/README.md`):

1. **Check for required sections** — Ensure both "For Humans" and "For AI" sections exist
2. **Verify AI metadata** — Confirm `<!-- AI_META -->` comment exists with proper JSON/YAML block
3. **Validate metadata keys** — Ensure all required keys are present: `purpose`, `publicApi`, `dependencies`, `tests`
4. **If structure is missing or incorrect**, prompt with minimal template

## Minimal Template

When structure violations are detected, provide this template:

```markdown
# For Humans

## Overview
[Describe what this slice does]

## How to Run
[Step-by-step instructions to run this slice]

## How to Test
[Instructions for testing this slice]

# For AI

<!-- AI_META -->
```json
{
  "purpose": "",
  "publicApi": [],
  "dependencies": [],
  "tests": {
    "location": "",
    "command": ""
  }
}
```
```

## Detected Violations

This rule flags these issues:

### Missing Sections
- Missing "For Humans" top-level header
- Missing "For AI" top-level header
- Extra or incorrectly named top-level sections

### Invalid AI Metadata
- Missing `<!-- AI_META -->` comment
- Missing JSON/YAML code block after AI_META comment
- Missing required metadata keys: `purpose`, `publicApi`, `dependencies`, `tests`
- Invalid JSON/YAML syntax in metadata block

### Incorrect Section Order
- "For AI" section appearing before "For Humans" section

## Error Messages

When violations are detected:

- **Missing sections**: "README.md must contain exactly two sections: '# For Humans' and '# For AI'"
- **Missing AI metadata**: "AI section must include '<!-- AI_META -->' comment with JSON/YAML metadata block"
- **Missing metadata keys**: "AI metadata must include keys: purpose, publicApi, dependencies, tests"
- **Invalid format**: "Use the minimal template to fix README.md structure"

## Layer-Specific Considerations

### Features (`app/features/*/README.md`)
- Focus on product functionality and user value
- Document feature flags and configuration options
- Include integration points with other features

### Pages (`app/pages/*/README.md`)
- Document routing and URL parameters
- Include SEO considerations and meta tags
- Document page-level data loading patterns

### Widgets (`app/widgets/*/README.md`)
- Document widget composition and layout
- Include props and configuration options
- Document responsive behavior and breakpoints

### Entities (`app/entities/*/README.md`)
- Document data models and business rules
- Include API schema and validation rules
- Document relationships with other entities

## Benefits

This standardized format provides:

- **Human Documentation**: Clear instructions for developers working with the slice
- **AI Integration**: Structured metadata for AI systems to understand slice context
- **Consistency**: Uniform documentation across all FSD layers
- **Discoverability**: Easy to locate testing and usage information
- **Maintainability**: Structured format makes updates easier

## Integration with FSD

This rule works with Feature-Sliced Design architecture by:
- Ensuring each slice in features, pages, widgets, and entities layers has proper documentation
- Supporting the baseline structure requirements across all FSD layers
- Providing clear boundaries between human and machine-readable content
- Facilitating slice understanding and integration across the entire application
